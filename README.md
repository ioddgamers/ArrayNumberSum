Learning JavaScript.

I decided to test myself with solving this problem. 

Sum of 3 Numbers: Write a function that takes an array of numbers and a target number. The function should find three different numbers in the array that, 
when added together, give the target number. Return the indices of the three numbers.

- I started by creating an array and a target number.
- I created a function with the array as its parameter.
- I then looped through the array three times using nested loops to get the numbers that could be added to give the target number.

It was a lot of challenge for me but I'm quite happy with the result!
